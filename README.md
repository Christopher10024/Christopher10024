- 👋 Hi, I’m @Christopher10024 – I am an artist by profession, but always learning new things, which is why I'm here.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about web design, 'alernative' blogging/website creation services, online privacy/security, and creating apps that interact with existing sites/databases. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub AND NextCloud (online), securely.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... {Not sure yet, on this one.]
- 📫 How to reach me ... {Need to learn how to use GitHub more, before I post this info.]
